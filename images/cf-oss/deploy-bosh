# We previously polled the BOSH Director IP using curl/wget. This had the
# problem of creating an unbounded number of TCP connections in the VM due to
# bad routing.
#
# This happened because the Director's subnet was not associated with a network
# device causing traffic to be routed outside the vm. Once outside due to
# the Director IP alias on the loopback device and since vpnkit was listening on
# the IP/port, traffic would flow back to the VM. Finally, the
# vpnkit-forwarder in the VM would make the same original request to the BOSH
# Director IP continuing the loop
